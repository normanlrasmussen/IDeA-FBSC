# Future Implementation Prompts for Football Recruiting Dashboard

This file contains LLM prompts for implementing alternative approaches to the React recruiting dashboard. Use these prompts when you want to explore different technologies or architectures.

## 1. Plotly React Implementation

**Prompt:**
"Convert the existing React Leaflet + D3.js implementation to use Plotly React for easier porting from the Jupyter notebook. The application should have the same two pages (Connections Map and Size Graphs) with the same filtering capabilities. Use Plotly's built-in map features and maintain the same data processing logic. Include performance optimizations for large datasets and ensure the visualizations match the original notebook's appearance."

## 2. Mapbox GL JS Implementation

**Prompt:**
"Replace React Leaflet with Mapbox GL JS for enhanced 3D effects and better performance. Implement the same two-page structure with connections and size graphs. Use Mapbox's native circle and line layers instead of D3 overlays. Add 3D terrain and building visualization options. Include custom styling and ensure mobile responsiveness. Maintain all existing filtering and data processing functionality."

## 3. Backend API with Flask/FastAPI

**Prompt:**
"Create a backend API using Flask or FastAPI to serve the recruiting data instead of loading CSV client-side. The backend should provide endpoints for:
- GET /api/data - Return filtered recruiting data
- GET /api/colleges - Return unique colleges
- GET /api/years - Return year range
- GET /api/pathways - Return aggregated pathways
- GET /api/cities - Return city aggregations
- GET /api/colleges-data - Return college aggregations

Include data caching, pagination for large datasets, and CORS configuration. Update the React frontend to consume these APIs instead of processing CSV data directly."

## 4. Deck.gl Implementation

**Prompt:**
"Implement the recruiting dashboard using Deck.gl for GPU-accelerated rendering. Create the same two-page structure but use Deck.gl's ArcLayer for connections and ScatterplotLayer for size graphs. Add 3D visualization options and smooth animations. Include performance optimizations for handling large datasets (50k+ records) and maintain the same filtering capabilities. Use React with Deck.gl's React integration."

## 5. WebGL Custom Implementation

**Prompt:**
"Create a custom WebGL implementation using Three.js for the recruiting visualizations. Build the same two-page structure with:
- Custom shaders for connection lines with varying thickness and opacity
- Particle systems for high school and college markers
- Interactive 3D globe view option
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Performance optimizations for large datasets

Maintain all existing filtering and data processing logic while leveraging WebGL for maximum performance."

## 6. Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with Next.js

**Prompt:**
"Convert the React application to use Next.js with server-side rendering. Implement the same functionality but with:
- Server-side data processing and caching
- Static generation for better performance
- API routes for data endpoints
- Optimized bundle splitting
- SEO optimization for the dashboard pages

Maintain the same UI/UX but improve initial load times and SEO."

## 7. Real-time Data Updates

**Prompt:**
"Add real-time data update capabilities using WebSockets. Implement:
- Live data streaming for new recruiting commitments
- Real-time map updates without page refresh
- Collaborative filtering (multiple users can see each other's selections)
- Data versioning and conflict resolution
- Push notifications for significant recruiting events

Maintain the existing React structure but add real-time capabilities."

## 8. Mobile-First PWA

**Prompt:**
"Convert the dashboard to a Progressive Web App (PWA) with mobile-first design. Implement:
- Offline functionality with service workers
- Touch-optimized map interactions
- Swipe gestures for navigation
- Mobile-specific UI components
- App-like experience on mobile devices
- Push notifications for recruiting updates

Maintain all existing functionality while optimizing for mobile usage."

## 9. Multi-language Support

**Prompt:**
"Add internationalization (i18n) support to the recruiting dashboard. Implement:
- Multiple language support (English, Spanish, French)
- Localized data formatting (dates, numbers)
- RTL language support
- Dynamic language switching
- Localized map labels and tooltips
- Cultural adaptations for different regions

Maintain the same functionality while supporting multiple languages and regions."

## 10. Advanced Analytics Dashboard

**Prompt:**
"Extend the dashboard with advanced analytics features. Add:
- Statistical analysis of recruiting patterns
- Trend analysis over time
- Geographic heat maps
- Predictive modeling for recruiting success
- Export functionality for reports
- Custom dashboard creation
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities

Maintain the existing map visualizations while adding comprehensive analytics features."
