This is a list of features to implement

1) Publish to Github
2) Add a new page to compare connections or circles of 2 different time periods. (left and right side)
3) Maybe add some change over time graphs
    - College recruitment over time
    - Amount of people cities send out over time
    - How much of each city a college receives over time
4) Filter back in Interantional recruits. Add extra dots at the edge of the map to do this (specifcally hawaii)
